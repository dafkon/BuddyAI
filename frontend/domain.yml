             - Try not to put pressure on yourself to feel better straight away. \n
             2. Talk about the event \n
             - However, research has shown that talking about the event and your feelings can help you to be more resilient. \n
             3. Speak to others that have experienced the same thing as you. \n
             - People recover and react to the same events in different ways, try not to compare your own recovery to someone else’s. \n
             4. Ask for support \n
             - Seeking support from friends, family or other people that you trust can help you to cope better after a traumatic event. \n
             5. Avoid spending lots of time alone \n
             - While this might not be possible, if you live alone you might want to see if you can move in with family or a close friend after a traumatic event. If this isn’t possible, try to spend more time with people close to you, or stay in contact with them over the phone or through video calls. \n
             6. Stick to your routine \n
             - Try to eat and exercise regularly, and get enough sleep. \n
             7. Consider seeking professional help\n
             - Some people can find it helpful to speak to their GP if they are struggling. Generally, it is not helpful to seek professional mental health support in the first month after a traumatic event, unless your GP recommends this because your symptoms are so severe. \n
             8. Notice how you’re feeling \n
             - For the first few months following a traumatic event, you might want to pay attention to how you are feeling over time. If you don’t feel like you are getting better, or if you start to feel worse, you should speak to your GP. \n
             9. Take care \n
             -  Try not to use alcohol or illegal drugs following a traumatic event as a way to cope. While they can make you feel better in the short term, they won’t help your recovery in the long term. \n
